Hi, Im a unreal engine generalist who inreseted in creating fun stuff

I started as a 3d hardsurface artists then done rigging, animating then creating locomotion systems, game mechanics also little bit of replication
i also worked with a team around 5 people and used diversion version control with unreal for the past 3 years.

Im not a specialist but more like a unreal engine generalist, i dont have much programming background but i like to make things that i enjoy playing with things i know while learning and collaborating with others

Experience: Blender 3d modeling
            Unreal Engine Level Sequencer, Replication, Animation Systems, Game Mechanics, Chaos vehicles
            Maya Rigging
            Houdini kinefx rigging framework and Vertex Animations
            Benchmarking and Optimizations
            Linux


I enjoy playing ps2 ps3 era games
